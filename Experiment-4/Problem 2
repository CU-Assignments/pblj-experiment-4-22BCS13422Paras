Develop a ticket booking system with synchronized threads to ensure no double booking of seats. Use thread priorities to simulate VIP bookings being processedÂ first.
CODE:-
class TicketBooking {
    private int availableSeats = 10; // Total available seats

    // Synchronized method to book a seat
    public synchronized void bookSeat(String customerType) {
        if (availableSeats > 0) {
            System.out.println(customerType + " is booking a seat...");
            availableSeats--;
            System.out.println(customerType + " booked a seat successfully. Seats left: " + availableSeats);
        } else {
            System.out.println(customerType + " tried to book a seat, but no seats are available.");
        }
    }
}

class BookingThread extends Thread {
    private TicketBooking ticketBooking;
    private String customerType;

    public BookingThread(TicketBooking ticketBooking, String customerType) {
        this.ticketBooking = ticketBooking;
        this.customerType = customerType;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        ticketBooking.bookSeat(customerType);
    }
}

public class TicketBookingSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TicketBooking ticketBooking = new TicketBooking();

        // Create threads for VIP customers
        BookingThread vip1 = new BookingThread(ticketBooking, "VIP Customer 1");
        BookingThread vip2 = new BookingThread(ticketBooking, "VIP Customer 2");
        BookingThread regular1 = new BookingThread(ticketBooking, "Regular Customer 1");
        BookingThread regular2 = new BookingThread(ticketBooking, "Regular Customer 2");

        // Set thread priorities
        vip1.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // VIP customers have high priority
        vip2.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
        regular1.setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY); // Regular customers have normal priority
        regular2.setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY);

        // Start the threads
        vip1.start();
        vip2.start();
        regular1.start();
        regular2.start();
    }
}

OUTPUT:-
VIP Customer 1 is booking a seat...
VIP Customer 1 booked a seat successfully. Seats left: 9
VIP Customer 2 is booking a seat...
VIP Customer 2 booked a seat successfully. Seats left: 8
Regular Customer 1 is booking a seat...
Regular Customer 1 booked a seat successfully. Seats left: 7
Regular Customer 2 is booking a seat...
Regular Customer 2 booked a seat successfully. Seats left: 6
